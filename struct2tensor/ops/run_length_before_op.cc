The `run_length_before` op, given [a_0,...,a_n], returns [b_0,...,b_n] where:
  b_n := \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} I(a_i=a_n)
  This assumes that for all a_i, a_j, if i <= j, then a_i <= a_j.

This is useful for creating the last index column of a ragged array, or from
converting from global orderings to local orderings or dewey orderings.

For example:
  input:  [0, 0, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9]
  output: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

ordered_indices: a int64 vector where for all i, a[i] <= a[i+1]
run_length_before: for all n:
   run_length_before[n] := \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} I(a_i=a_n)
