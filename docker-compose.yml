version: '3.1'

# Extensions are not support until 3.4 thus the repeated boilerplate below.

# We mount the struct2tensor project root at /struct2tensor (which is the WORKDIR of the image)
# in the container.
#
# We need to set PYTHON_VERSION in `build` command which is used to pick the
# base TF SIG Build image.
# The TF_VERSION environment variables is expected when run the pipeline
# Valid TF_VERSION are NIGHTLY_TF|NIGHTLY_TF_2|RELEASED_TF|PRERELEASED_TF|RELEASED_TF_2|PRERELEASED_TF_2
# Sample usage:
# docker-compose build --build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=3.7 manylinux2014
# docker-compose run -e TF_VERSION=NIGHTLY_TF manylinux2014
